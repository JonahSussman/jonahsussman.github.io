I have a certain affinity for retro computing. It is most likely due to the fact that I watched a lot of retro gaming YouTube channels like the Angry Video Game Nerd <sup>(content warning: swear words abound)</sup>, Lazy Game Reviews, and The 8-Bit Guy. I was even inspired by the likes of bisqwit, lftkryo and the UzeBox project to create chiptunes and participate in the demoscene a bit.

Nowadays there are a lot of layers between you and the hardware. The days where you can initiate real mode and just output directly to the video memoery are long gone.
