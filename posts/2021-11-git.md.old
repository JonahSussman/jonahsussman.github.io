There comes a time in every software engineer's life where they have to take a step back and appreciate the mountain of human effort that has been put into this field we call "Computer Science." Gathering its roots from [a hole in the bottom of mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo) and the [cryptanalysis of the enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma) to the development of the first [UNIX operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and the [home computer explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computing), there has certainly been countless millions of man-hours put into this field.

I, like most developers nowadays, started somewhere in the middle of all this complexity. I "decided" that I was going to be a game developer (almost assuredly egged on by the absolute runaway success of Minecraft) and learned the basics of Java. Then, over the next decade, I spent time filling in the gaps of my knowledge. I explored downward to transistors, electrical engineering, and CPU design. I explored upward to algorithmic efficiency, software engineering, and user experience. Every foray into the forest of knowledge elucidated a tiny fraction more as to why developers design programs the way they do.

And yet, even with all this effort, the area surrounding this middle part from where I started still eluded me. That is programming languages, operating systems, and common tools that I used every day. While the former two are being remedied by my time in university (roll tide!), the inner workings of the latter are still an enigma. 

As with most topics that you have no idea about, they always seem impregnable. How am I, a lowly individual, supposed to wade through the nearly [28 million lines of code in the Linux kernel](https://www.linux.com/news/linux-in-2020-27-8-million-lines-of-code-in-the-kernel-1-3-million-in-systemd/), or the [21 million lines of code in Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/code-quality-tools-at-mozilla/)?

The short answer? *You can't.*

At least not without devoting a significant amount of time to these megaprojects. But, looking at it from this angle is unproductive at best and defeatist at worst. These projects have had *years upon years* of *hundreds of people* committing changes to them. Instead, we should focus on smaller, more manageable projects first, like DOOM which has a meager [39k lines of code](https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/g7wbxr/number_of_lines_of_code_in_classic_doom/). And what you'll find is that the early versions of these behemoth-sized projects were often tiny. The first version of the Linux kernel was only [10,239 lines of code](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/anniversary-of-first-linux-kernel-release-a-look-at-collaborative-value/)!

And so, by examining the early versions of these projects, the versions that a single person can hope to analyze in a weekend, I hope to shine a light on my dark areas of knowledge.

## What is git?

I'm going to assume that most of you know what git is. If not, you can read about it [here](https://git-scm.com/). 

For those of you that don't, here's a quick explanation: In a nutshell, git is a program designed to make the act of large amounts of people working on a single project as smooth as possible. 

Imagine a situation where you've saved a file named `report`. You then email this file to your colleague for approval. Great! The only problem is that they have some minor corrections and named it `report_UPDATED`. You don't quite agree with some of these changes and send it back named `report_UPDATED_v2`. Then you get back `report_UPDATED_v3`, `report_UPDATE_v3_JONAH`, `report_UPDATED_v3_JONAH_FINAL`, `report_UPDATED_v3_JONAH_FINAL_for_real`, etc... 

Git helps you avoid all of that. Git controls versions; it's a *version control software* (VCS for short).

Linus Torvalds (of Linux fame) created Git in [about ten days or so](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds/#:~:text=So%20I%27d%20like%20to,of%20mad%20dash%20of%20coding.) in 2005 after discussions between the Linux kernel community and BitKeeper (the VCS they were using) [broke down](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git). To say that Linus is a good developer is an understatement.

## Git's source code

Now I bet a lot of you developers out there didn't know that the first version of git's source code is readily accessible. Look! [Here it is!](https://github.com/git/git/tree/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290). I'm sure I intuitively knew that it was, but I just never bothered to look...

Git, like most things dealing with GNU or Linux, is programmed in plain old C. Compiling the source code with `make` (be sure to update `LIBS` to include `LIBS=-lz -lcrypto`), I realized that there was no actual `git` ELF file. Instead, there are multiple different individual programs. That leads us to our first nugget of knowledge about the structure of git: **Git is actually composed of multiple different subprograms**. 

The `git` program simply parses the arguments you give to it and [pipes it along to the specified subprogram](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/common-main.c). [This rings true even today](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables). You can type `git --exec-path` to find the directory where these subprograms are stored. Using `ls | wc -l`, I counted 159 individual programs for the modern version of git!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the first version of git has numerous unique features (rephrase)

- Git is composed of multiple different subprograms
