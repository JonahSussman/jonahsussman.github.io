Almost all of my projects are native applications. I love the control and level of optimization that coding closer to the metal gives me. However, it often presents a problem if I want to showcase my body of work.

The last thing you want to tell someone who's checking out your work is "Hey, I totally did this thing. But first you have to download this foreign .exe file from the Internet. I *super duper pinky swear promise* that this application isn't malware." And by the time you're done saying that, they've already moved on to the next Big Thingâ„¢.

So for the longest time, screenshots and detailed explanations were all that I was able to give people.

So the big thing is advertizing. How to advertize your stuff.
